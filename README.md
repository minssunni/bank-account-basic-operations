# Bank Account Basic Operations

### Background
A very simple codebase to familiarise myself and gain confidence in using simple Java classes and basic Java constructs.

This repository models some very basic operations on bank accounts including deposits, withdraws and transfers to another account.

For withdraw and transfer operations, we need to make sure that the balance of the account is enough to perform the operations so it does not to go into overdraft.

Each bank account has an associated transactions limit that specifies how many transactions may be performed in one day. If an account reaches this limit, we cannot perform additional transactions.
